## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software development. This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing these essential concepts. Here's what you can expect to find:

- **Data Structures:** You'll find various implementations of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and more. Each data structure is organized in its own directory with clear explanations and sample code.

- **Algorithms:** The repository includes a wide range of algorithms, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. These algorithms are carefully documented and often accompanied by example problems.

- **Practice Problems:** To reinforce your learning, you'll find a collection of practice problems categorized by topic. These problems are a great way to apply the knowledge you've gained and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized with a clear folder structure to help you find what you need easily:

- `DataStructures/`: Contains various data structure implementations.

- `Algorithms/`: Contains different algorithm implementations.

- `PracticeProblems/`: Contains a wide array of practice problems, organized by category.
